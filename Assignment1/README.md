# My Shell

- In This Program I have implemented a small femto shell in which echos the entered commands by the user
    - It consists of one main while loop that keeps on iterating and taking input from the user as long as this input is not the word "exit"
    - As soon as the user enters "exit" the user is prompted with goodbye and the shell exits

- I have stored the commands entered by the user into a dynamic array to let him enter as many commands as he want in a single line
