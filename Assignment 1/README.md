# My First Shell

1- In my projct I have include the Following libraries:

- stdio -> Printf , Scanf functions
- stdlib -> to use the built in command exit()
- string -> to use strcmp


2- The program simply uses a main while loop to do:

- display the prompt I have used "Let's hack> "
- the user then enters a command using scanf function
- I have stored the input entered by the user using dynamic memory allocation in character format
- then prompt to the user his input unless:
     - if the user inputs exit then it invokes the exit method fom stlib in order to exit the program.
